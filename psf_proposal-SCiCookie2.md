- Introduction :

  SciCookie, developed by Open Science Labs, is a versatile tool that
  generates projects from templates, streamlining the initial setup
  process for developers. A project template acts as a pre-arranged
  framework for new projects, providing a standardized but customizable
  structure. This helps users quickly kick-start their development with
  best practices, especially beneficial in, but not limited to, the
  scientific Python community. By reducing setup time and ensuring
  consistency, project templates like SciCookie enable developers to
  focus more on unique aspects of their work rather than initial
  configuration.

- Objective *:

  The following is an explicit list of some of the objectives that we
  can achieve with this grant:

  - Enhancement of Project Template Standards.
  - Documentation and User Interface Improvements.
  - Code Quality and Community Standards Compliance.

  Enhance the SciCookie project template by reducing technical debt
  related to maintenance, dependencies and build system. Currently, this
  template project tool allows the user to automate the process of
  creating a Python project with all the necessary up-to-date
  technologies. Via configuration options, each user is able to
  establish their unique set of dependencies. With the work planned for
  this grant, the changes will allow an improved user experience while
  guaranteeing a robust project template options.

  SciCookie Team also plans to apply for the PyOpenSci review process, so this
  grant will be used to review all the evaluation criteria, present the
  project there and apply the suggestions from the review process. It is
  very important for us to be able to apply to PyOpenSci as it is, if
  accepted, will allow us to raise awareness of our package and thus
  contribute to the development of the Python and open source community.  

  SciCookie Team looking for Open Science Labs to grow and to be known
  by the Python community, we have promoted some Python meetings
  (pycafe) online. In the OSL discord the SciCookie Team maintain a
  Python group, divided by various topics of interest, and we spread
  Python through the various projects in incubation that use it.

- Beneficiaries *:

  In general, although we are focusing on the scientific Python
  community, this cookiecutter template could be used by anyone who
  wants to create a Python package.

  With this grant, we plan to contract 4 people from our current group
  of collaborators in OSL. The main two developers are Yurely Camacho
  and Anavelyz Perez based in Merida-Venezuela, recently graduated in
  statistics and they are enthusiastic about open science and
  programming languages like Python. They contributed to the translation
  of the documentation at Spanish of the library scikit-learn. Each of
  them will have an hourly intensity of 70 hours during the eight weeks
  of the project. Additionally, a Project manager and one Senior
  Developer for Review and quality assurance, these individuals will
  have an hourly intensity of 10 and 20 hours, respectively.

  This grant will also be accompanied and mentored mainly by Ivan Ogasawara, a
  member of the Open Science Labs steering council. He has been chair of
  the SciPy Latinoamerica (SciPyLA) 2016 conference. He had been a
  maintainer of the SciPyLA community on telegram from 2016 to 2022,
  promoting the SciPyLA Ambassador program, assisting new chairs in the
  organization structure of the conferences.

- Regional Support

    The remain funding would be used to maintain the template updated.
